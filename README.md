Ruby Blog
=========

This is a simple demo blog application written in Ruby on Rails. It was created following the [Getting Started Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) on [RubyOnRails.org](http://rubyonrails.org). This blog diverges from the Getting Started Guide in that it uses the [Bootstrap3](http://getbootstrap.com/) front-end framework.

You can view this application live on [Heroku](http://whispering-wave-9825.herokuapp.com/). For administrative tasks, use the username "btorell" and the password "brivity".
